# Troubleshooting Mode

Troubleshooting Mode disables all plugins and all custom CSS, JavaScript, and locales. It also temporarily sets the log level to `DEBUG`. This is useful when you are experiencing issues with your Stash instance to eliminate the possibility that a plugin or custom code is causing the issue.

Troubleshooting Mode is enabled from the Settings page, by clicking the `Troubleshooting Mode` button at the bottom left of the page.

When Troubleshooting Mode is enabled, a red border and a banner will be displayed to remind you that you are in Troubleshooting Mode. To exit Troubleshooting Mode, click the `Exit` button in the banner.
